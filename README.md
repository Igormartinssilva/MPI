# MPI
Using MPI library for test matriz multiplication
# What test
- Matriz order number = 2048, 8192 e 16.384
- nodes number = 1,2,3 e 4
- number tasks = 40,80, 120 e 160 
- run = coletiva, naobloqueante and bloqueante

maybe see something to chance in the code

# Usefuly commands
- sinfo
- sin
- squeue: this see the all jobs in the queue, very good
- to run: sbatch run.slurm

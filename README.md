# MPI
Using MPI library in order to test different matrix multiplication applications
# Testing variables
- Matrix order number = 2048, 8192 e 16.384
- number of nodes = 1,2,3 e 4
- number of tasks = 40,80, 120 e 160 
- run = coletiva, naobloqueante and bloqueante

Perhaps look out to change something in the code
# Useful commands
- sinfo
- sin
- squeue:visualizes all the jobs in the queue, great!
- runs the application: sbatch run.slurm
